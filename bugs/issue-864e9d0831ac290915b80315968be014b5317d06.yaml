title: fix FOUC-ish flash of reformatting
desc: |-
  after the page loads, WN inserts a synthetic stylesheet to change font size
  and
  remove some unnecessary page components.  however, the page fully renders
  without this stylesheet, and is visible, and *then* in a second or three,
  the new style is shown.
